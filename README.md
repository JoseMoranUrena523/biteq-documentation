# Welcome Page

### About

Biteq is a Bitcoin Lightning API made by Teqquu in collaboration with CLB Productions. It is powered by LNbits and LNpay and was made to combat against ZEBEDEEâ€™s which is difficult for developers to implement (took me 2 weeks in total while this can take less time!)

### How-to

Make sure you have your own personal wallet like Wallet of Satoshi or [NOAH](https://app.noah.com/?referralCode=josemoranurena) (don't recommend ZEBEDEE with their low response times). Before you make your request, contact Niight#6942 or Coffee L. Arkoburger#5667 for an API key to use Biteq. Once you have it, always do your request with the header with the name of `Authorization` and the value of `Bearer API_KEY`.

### Note

Please do not put life-changing amounts to Biteq. While we make sure the API has a secure backend and no one has access to it other than the developers, anything could happen and all your sats would be gone. Teqquu and CLB Productions are not responsible for any loss, nor LNbits or LNpay.
